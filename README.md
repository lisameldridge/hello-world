# hello-world
It is what it is.

The mail came early that day. I remember thinking later that if I hadn't stayed until the end of the Triple Terror Show at McCarthy's Theater, I never woulda slept late. But the clock was busted, and I woke up an hour late. And the mail was an hour early.

I'm writing a little bit about myself.
